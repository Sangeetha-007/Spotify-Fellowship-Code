Hi, I wasn't able to solve this one because I only found about this fellowship at the last minute. 
But, an appraoch I am thinking of is to use a for loop and start with i as 1, then we ask ourselves,
what is the smallest value you can use to make for using "1s", and we increment that 1 until we reach 
the value we need, in the situation provided, it is 4. We will continue slowly increasing this value of
i.
